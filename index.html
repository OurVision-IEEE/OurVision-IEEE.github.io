                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Globally, the number of visually impaired people is <strong>estimated to be around 285 million</strong> and those legally blind are estimated to be around 39 million. To put these numbers into perspective, let's create a nation composed of only visually impaired people. Subtracting the visually impaired populations from all the countries, this country would be the world's third most populous country. The people who are legally blind - while smaller in number, are suffering more. 39 million is more people than those who live in Canada, the world's second largest country by landmass. These people suffer problems and as engineers, we must strive to solve them using the emerging technologies available to us in all fields of engineering.  
<div>Machine learning is a field which has exploded in 2010's - its power to solve seemingly impossible problems to the traditional programming paradigms has made it being one of the most researched topics of the decade. It's ability to be applied in any field of study and problem solving has made it very convenient. From simple classification to self-driving cars - it's applications are far and wide. Our vision is to use the power of Machine Learning to solve the problems faced by visually impaired people. 
</div><div>The ability of gaining knowledge by reading books is one of the main modes of transferring knowledge used by humans. One might say this might be the reason for humans to be the apex predator on the planet. The ability of researching, the ability of noting it down and passing it to descendants for them to research is the reason for civilization to achieve what we have achieved till now. The notion that a portion of humans are unable to have the inherent ability to read books is disheartening but it is also a very important problem we have to solve. 
</div><div>This project aims to create a product to tackle this problem. The main focus of this product would be reading out the books loud. This was a seemingly impossible-to-solve problem half a century ago but now we have the technology to solve it. This product is developed using a microcontroller as the main body - along with many components. The key is the software. Using many well known algorithms and machine learning models, we aim to create a product which will be able to read books out loud for visually impaired people.</div></h4>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style align-center mb-4 display-2"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">A good eyesight <em><strong>facilitates </strong></em>us in carrying out day to day activities. The same activities can tend to be challenging for those devoid of it. The visually impaired, like everyone else, pursue a great range of interests, but a large percentage of them are unemployed due to <strong>lack of adequate resources</strong> to learn from. One out of every three blind persons in the world lives in India, which also constitutes about 2 million blind children with <strong>only 5%</strong> of them receiving any form of education. The number of blind schools and institutions available in the country aren't enough to educate such a large population. A survey was conducted at a reputed association for the blind in Bangalore in order to have a better insight into the kind of problems they face. The challenges they mentioned included <strong>difficulty in navigation, avoiding obstacles in their way, locating their destination and being unable to read and write</strong>. A handful of devices focusing on helping the blind navigate were developed, but one of their main concerns was to be assisted with reading and learning.
<div><strong>Braille</strong>, which is a partial transliteration of the English written language, was invented by Louis Braille to help people with low vision in reading. It is a tactile writing system traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can also read computer screens using refreshable braille displays which are electro-mechanical devices used for displaying braille characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface. Though Braille helped the blind read textual content, it had a <strong><em>few limitations</em></strong>. Not every blind person was taught braille and a limited number of braille books were printed due to which there is a need to develop a product that can be used by the visually impaired to overcome these drawbacks and avoid being dependent on people at all times. Reasons for the low rate of Braille literacy include a shortage of Braille teachers, inadequate resources and difficulty for the blind to learn braille. This hints a need to bring in easier methods to help them read and comprehend text.
</div><div>Most visually impaired people also <strong>depend </strong>on others to be acquainted with objects surrounding them and to avoid collision with obstacles while navigating. To address these problems and help them self-learn as well as become more aware of their surroundings, there is a need for <strong>a product</strong> using various technologies for the<strong> extraction of text and recognition of objects</strong>. Thus, the proposed product can read out text from newspapers, books, boards or anything that has text on it and also enumerate objects in his surroundings to aid the visually impaired and the blind. The incorporation of text extraction and object recognition techniques is what powers our idea and obtaining these results with maximum accuracy and minimum latency is desirable, as the final goal is to deliver the textual information to the visually impaired as and when they require it. Also, the product design is made such that it is <strong>lightweight, wearable and easily portable</strong> thus providing complete mobility to the user.</div></h4>

It is a <strong>non-profit organization</strong> that caters to helping the blind by supporting them with lessons and activities that improvise their everyday activities. Visiting the organization as a part of the requirement phase gave a more clear picture on their problems which facilitated in building a <strong><em>more definitive solution</em></strong>. The visually impaired there faced a lot of problems in their everyday activities. They elucidated that being unable to read and also being incapable of identifying objects around them without feeling them were their major obstacles in carrying out basic routines and also in finding employment. This hindrance can however be reduced with the <strong>advancements in technology</strong>.</h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">This project revolves around building a wearable product that aims at helping the visually impaired in their everyday endeavors. Its functionality consists of reading out the text around them. Our product does not need network connection to work. We leverage the power of edge computing, raspberry pi and low level programming to make our product computationally and power efficient. It is assumed that the user can wear the device on his own or has external guidance while doing so. Additionally, the required text has to be in the view of the user and consequently, in the scene of the product. The accuracy and features mentioned work best under good lighting, pertinent distance and when worn exactly on the forehead.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>

                            <strong>Proposed Model</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The proposed product aims at extracting the text from images captured using the camera and is also responsible for recognising the objects in the scene and giving out this information as an audio output to the visually impaired. It makes use of an Ultrasonic sensor which helps in determining whether the paper to be read is at the most accurate distance with respect to the camera. Once the image is captured by the camera, which could be an image of either a book or a newspaper or any kind of board around them, the image is sent to the Optical Character Recognition module which is supported by Google Cloud Vision Library. Once the text has been extracted and written to a text file, the same image is sent to the Object recognition module which is again supported by the same Cloud Vision Library and the output is written to a separate text file. The speed at while these files are generated is only limited by the presence of viable internet connection or Wi-Fi connectivity These text files are then read out via a speaker or earphones after they are passed to the text to speech module that uses a ported version of gTTS python library which is an interface to Google's Text to Speech API. The library allows for unlimited lengths of spoken text by tokenizing long sentences where the speech would naturally pause. The system includes two modes, a static mode where an image is captured and passed to the other modules only when the button is clicked by the user and a dynamic mode that continuously captures images and reads out the corresponding output until the user shuts down the device. The need for the dynamic mode arises when the visually impaired person prefers to use the device while navigating in the outside world by himself and wants to be aware of the objects and information around him, thus helping him read anything given to him without the help of an instructor or the need for braille. The product will hence prove to be a multi-functional equipment for the visually impaired.&nbsp;<br></p>
